Problem : printing neatly

Consider the problem of neatly printing a paragraph with a monospaced font (all 
characters having the same width) on a printer. The input text is a sequence of
N_n words of lengths l_1, l_2, l..., l_n, measured in characters. We want to print
this paragraph neatly on a number of lines that hold a maximum of M characters 
each. Our criterion of "neatness" is as follows. 

If a given line contains words i through j, where iâ‰¤j, and we leave exactly one
space between words, the number of extra space characters at the end of the line 
is M - j + i, which must be nonnegative so that the words fit on the line. We wish
to minimize the sum, over all lines except the last, of the cubes of the numbers 
of extra space characters at the ends of lines. 

1.Give a dynamic-programming algorithm to print a paragraph of n words neatly on a
printer. 
2.Analyze the running time and space requirements of your algorithm.
